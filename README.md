# WebServerFromScratch
A webserver made from scratch in Python to learn more about how webservers work.

I found that I have made a lot of projects involving webservers in different ways. This is a project that I made to learn the lower levels aspects of webservers. 

If you access "/host" it will generate room code, after it is generated then open another tab with just "/" and enter the room code you got from "/host" if it matches you will be redirected to "/main" saying access granted and wish you welcome.
